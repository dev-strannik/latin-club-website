## Introduction

Latin Club asked me to make a website for them.
It is supposed to be a place for all the Latin related resources the club wants in one place: interesting articles, learning resources, funny memes, and other things.

I have decided to make it using [Hugo,](https://gohugo.io/) "The worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites."
I haven't really build websites before -- this is my first.
Hugo was the best choice: it is open-source and extremely easy to use -- you just write Markdown.

> Markdown is so nice and simple!

## Struggle

I had to spend too much time talking to ChatGPT.
It will explain something to you with absolute confidence, then after several hours of troubleshooting you confront it how nothing work it says _oopsie here is the working code_...
But still nothing works.
The condescending advice to _RTFM_ is way more helpful than AI hallucinations.
