## Publish Posts

All posts are written in [Markdown,](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) a easy markup language to format documents.
If you want your post to be published you can't use anything else.
I recommend [ghostwriter](https://ghostwriter.kde.org/) for your Markdown text editor because it has a decent output preview simple UI.

### Some Guidelines

- Please start every sentense from a new line.
  One line -- one sentense.
- If you want something fancy inside your post -- like a photo gallery or embeded Youtube player -- ask me to help with the Hugo shortcode for it.
  Just put an "**ALL CAPS, BOLD**" placeholder when submitting.
- Start your Markdown file with something like this:

```

title = 'How to Add Content'
date = 2024-06-09T15:17:18-04:00
author = "Strannik"
categories = ["timeless"]
tags = ["informational", "instructions"]
+++
```

- `title`, and `author` are self explenatory.
  However for `date` you don't have to worry about the time, just make sure the date is right, time doesn't matter.
- Keep reading for `tags` and `categories` explanations.

### Pick Tags

Here's list of existing tags.
They are pretty self-explanatory.
Pick at least one, but add your own if necessary.

{{< list-site-tags >}}

### Pick a Category

> Don't add your own category.

- _timeless_ -- assign when the topic you are writing on is on something untied to a contemporary event, when you think it will not become outdated. Examples are tutorials, instructions, general opinion articles, tips or, guides.

- _momentary_ -- assign when you are writing about something relevant only for a specifc period, like news, updates, trip recap, or event blogpost.

## Upload Memes

1. For memes just get the files with non-exotic extention (`.webp`, `.jpg` or `.png`).
2. Then name them all lowercase using dashes (`-`) instead of spaces (`doge-speaking-latin.jpg`).
3. [Let me know](mailto:public_mail@tutanota.com) (`public_mail@tutanota.com`) that you want your memes to be uploaded and we'll figure out the easiest way.
   > Or upload directly to [Github.](https://github.com/dev-strannik/latin-club-website)
