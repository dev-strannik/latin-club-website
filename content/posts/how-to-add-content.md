## Publish Posts

All posts are written in [Markdown,](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) a easy markup language to format documents.
If you want your post to be published you can't use anything else.
I recommend [ghostwriter](https://ghostwriter.kde.org/) for your Markdown text editor because it has a decent output preview simple UI.

### Some Guidelines

- Please start every sentense from a new line.
  One line -- one sentense.
- If you want something fancy inside your post -- like a photo gallery or embeded Youtube player -- ask me to help with the Hugo shortcode for it.
  Just put an "**ALL CAPS, BOLD**" placeholder when submitting.

## Upload Memes

1. For memes just get the files with non-exotic extention (`.webp`, `.jpg` or `.png`).
2. Then name them all lowercase using dashes (`-`) instead of spaces (`doge-speaking-latin.jpg`).
4. [Let me know](mailto:public_mail@tutanota.com) (`public_mail@tutanota.com`) that you want your memes to be uploaded and we'll figure out the easiest way.
